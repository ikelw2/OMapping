The purpose of this repository is to enable anyone with access to LIDAR data to be able to make orienteering maps using free open source software.  For more information about the sport of orienteering, visit https://landnavapp.com/orienteering.html


<br>
The instruction uses https://www.openorienteering.org/apps/mapper/ for creating orienteering maps, and https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/ for processing LIDAR and GIS data.

<br>
This repository contains an HTML instruction page for downloading the LIDAR and processing it for use in OpenOrienteering Mapper.  Just copy to your computer or a website in order to view.

<P>
The purpose of this repository (separate file viewable at https://landnavapp.com/mapping/mapping.html) is to enable anyone with access to LIDAR data to be able to make orienteering maps using free open source software.  For more information about the sport of orienteering, visit https://landnavapp.com/orienteering.html

The instruction uses https://www.openorienteering.org/apps/mapper/ for creating orienteering maps, and https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/ for processing LIDAR and GIS data.
